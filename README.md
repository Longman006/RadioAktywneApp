# RadioAktywneApp
The android application for RadioAktywne
So far requires disabling SSL Certificate checking. 
Uses a Service to play audio from URL through a simple instance of MediaPlayer. 
Need to implement : 

1.Medialayer Error handling
2.AudioFocus
3.NotificationBar
4.Clean-up xml files. The naming is inconsistant, and it would be nice to use constraintLayout wherever possible and get rid of fixed values like "90dp" and much more :P The xml files were my main problem so far. 

Please feel free to add suggetions and improvements!
